# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

This is my submission for the project assignment in course 2 of the Udacity
Cloud Developer Nanodegree.

## To run locally

You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:

1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. run the development server with `npm run dev`

### To test the APIs

After starting the development server, you can test the image-filtering service as follows:

1. Launch Postman
2. Import the collection `image-filter.postman_collection.json`
3. Press the play button next to the *image-filter* collection to open the collection runner. 
4. Press the button labelled *Run image-filter* near the bottom of the screen.
